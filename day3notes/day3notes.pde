// boolean mousePressed; // mousePressed will be initialized to false unless you do otherwise
// if ([the operating system says the mouse has been pressed]) {
//   mousePressed = true;
// } else {
//   mousePressed = false;
// }

// the variable mousePressed already is true or false inherently because it is a boolean

// relational operators create statements that evaluate to true or false, eg 4 == 5 is false

// if (mousePressed)
// if (mousePressed == true)
